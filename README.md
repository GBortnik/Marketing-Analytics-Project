# Marketing Analytics Project
This project focuses on analyzing marketing datasets. It includes:
- **SQL** database preparation
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Additional **Sentiment Analysis** in **Python**
- Final **Power BI** report creation

Static PDF export of the dashboards is available [here](/Marketing%20Analysis%20Report.pdf). Please note that the PDF version does not retain interactive features.

## SQL Data Preparation

Data cleaning and transformation were performed primarily in **SQL** using dedicated queries, including processes such as data normalization, value categorization and duplicates removal.

**Initial Data Processing:**
- [Product name correction](/Product%20Name%20Correction.sql)
- [Duplicate verification in Customer Journey table](/Checking%20Duplicates%20in%20Customer_Journey.sql)

**Fact Tables Preparation:**
- [Customer Journey](/fact%20Customer%20Journey%20Query.sql)
- [Engagement Data](/fact%20Engagement%20Data%20Query.sql)

**Dimension Tables Preparation:**
- [Products catalog](/dim%20Products%20Query.sql)
- [Customers & Geography](/dim%20Customers,%20Geography%20Query.sql)

*Note: Customer Reviews table was additionally processed using Python for [sentiment analysis](#python-sentiment-analysis).*

## Python Sentiment Analysis

The Customer Reviews sentiment analysis was performed in Python using following workflow:
1. **Database Connection**: Established via SQLAlchemy
2. **Data Loading**: Imported into Pandas DataFrame
3. **Sentiment Processing**:
   - NLTK's VADER for sentiment scoring
   - Added columns: `SentimentScore`, `SentimentCategory`, `SentimentBucket`
4. **Results Export**: Saved enhanced dataset to CSV for Power BI integration

*Full code is available [here](/sentiment_analysis.py).*

## Model Relationship
The data model incorporates:
- All tables previously prepared in SQL and Python
- An additional **`dim_calendar`** dimension table created via DAX measure. Measure can be found in [Additional DAX Measures](#additional-dax-measures) section.

**Relationship Configuration:**
- Dimension Tables â†” Fact Tables:  
  ðŸ”— **One-to-many** relationships  
  ðŸ”„ **Single-direction** cross-filtering (from dimensions to facts)

## Additional DAX Measures
The project utilizes supplemental **DAX measures**, including creation of the dimension table `dim_calendar` and the `Conversion Rate` metric. Details below:

- Calendar Dimension Table

Centralized date reference for time-based analysis in Power BI. 
``` 
dim_calendar = 
ADDCOLUMNS (
    CALENDAR ( DATE ( 2023, 1, 1 ), DATE ( 2025, 12, 31 ) ),
    "DateAsInteger", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYYMMDD" ),
    "Year", YEAR ( [Date] ),
    "Monthnumber", FORMAT ( [Date], "MM" ),
    "YearMonthnumber", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYY/MM" ),
    "YearMonthShort", FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYY/mmm" ),
    "MonthNameShort", FORMAT ( [Date], "mmm" ),
    "MonthNameLong", FORMAT ( [Date], "mmmm" ),
    "DayOfWeekNumber", WEEKDAY ( [Date] ),
    "DayOfWeek", FORMAT ( [Date], "dddd" ),
    "DayOfWeekShort", FORMAT ( [Date], "ddd" ),
    "Quarter", "Q" & FORMAT ( [Date], "Q" ),
    "YearQuarter",
        FORMAT ( [Date], "YYYY" ) & "/Q"
            & FORMAT ( [Date], "Q" )
)
```

- Conversion Rate

Calculates the percentage of visitors who made a purchase (Views â†’ Purchases).

```
Conversion Rate = 
VAR TotalVisitors = 
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(fact_customer_journey[JourneyID]),
        fact_customer_journey[Action] = "View"
    )
VAR TotalPurchases = 
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(fact_customer_journey[JourneyID]),
        fact_customer_journey[Action] = "Purchase"
    )
RETURN
    IF(
        TotalVisitors = 0,
        0,
        DIVIDE(TotalPurchases, TotalVisitors)
    )
```

- Positive Reviews Percentage

Calculates the percentage of positive reviews (Positive or Mixed Positive Category)

```
PositiveReviewsPercentage = 
VAR TotalReviews = COUNTROWS(fact_reviews_sentiment)
VAR PositiveReviews =
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS(fact_reviews_sentiment),
        fact_reviews_sentiment[SentimentCategory] IN { "Mixed Positive", "Positive" }
    )
RETURN
DIVIDE(PositiveReviews, TotalReviews, 0)
```

## Power BI Report
